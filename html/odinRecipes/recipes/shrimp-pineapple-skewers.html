    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp and Pineapple Skewers are a 
        delightful blend of succulent shrimp and sweet pineapple, enhanced
        by a homemade teriyaki sauce. This sauce, featuring soy sauce, 
        mirin, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger, balances sweet, salty, and 
        umami flavors, creating a unique, tasty marinade for the shrimp. 
        Finished with sesame seeds and green onions, the dish boasts 
        additional crunch and a vibrant color palette.</p>

    <p>In this recipe, the shrimp, marinated in the teriyaki sauce and then
        grilled, is a flavor-packed star. The addition of grilled pineapple
        provides a sweet, slightly charred counterpoint to the savory
        shrimp. Served on skewers, this pairing becomes an easy-to-handle,
        festive dish – a delightful culinary creation merging simple 
        ingredients with rich flavors.</p>
